                                Coming from small rural colleges and high schools in Bourgogne Franche-Comté, he had never dabbled in programming before high school. However, his passion for video games drove him to explore it on his own through Unity3D, in order to uncover the behind-the-scenes aspects of game development. He then decided to join EPITA with the goal of pursuing a future in software development and programming. It was his motivation to create his very first video game that led him to take on the role of group leader for this project.</p>

For him, his path in computer science was clear. That's when he decided to join EPITA with the goal of building his future in the field of computer science.</p>

                <div>
                    Our team was initially composed of 4 members: Jeremie Levan, Noah Contal, Tom Giles, and Lucas Giglielmetti. However, Lucas left Epita shortly before the first presentation, and the group continued with 3 members until the second presentation. After the second presentation, with the group nearly dissolved, Nino Zanfonato joined Episoft. Now, the team once again consists of 4 members.
