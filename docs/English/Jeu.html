This project is a puzzle/enigma video game. In this game, you play as a scientist whose goal is to repair his time-travel machine in order to escape from your captors who want to prevent you from completing your machine. To do so, you will need to navigate through three levels while solving puzzles and enigmas. To assist you in this quest, you can be accompanied by your friends who can join you. But that's not all, you will also have abilities, such as the ability to travel back in time

In this game, you will navigate through an environment created in a LowPoly style. This style is inherently minimalist, and to achieve this environment, objects are created in 3D with a limited number of polygons. Unlike a realistic game, this one deliberately showcases the square shapes of the models to give an impression of simplicity.
